# RGBCar plugin for TM2020
This plugin allows you to change your cars' color, depending on a variety of factors:
- Speed: the faster you go, the more your car changes color.
- RPM: synced with the Speedometer plugin's colors (does not include white or black).
- Per-car colors: so you can have your classic colors on the original cars.
