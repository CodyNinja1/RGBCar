# RGBCar plugin for TM2020
This plugin allows you to change your cars' color, depending on a variety of factors:
- Speed: the faster you go, the more your car changes color.
- RPM: can be per RPM value, or synced with Speedometer.
- Per-car colors: so you can have your classic colors on the original cars.
